# Connectivity-Checker

This Python project uses the urllib and tkinter modules to test website connectivity.
Weâ€™ve used the tkinter module to create a GUI allowing users to enter a web address.
we simply determine whether the HTTP code is 200. If it is, we know the site is working; otherwise, we inform the user that it is unavailable.
